CherryAC
========

Old Garry's Mod 12 Anti Cheat I used on SammyServers for about a year. Caught SethHack, ColdFire, FapHack and the vast majority of other cheats. Most of it is unlikely to work now, but someone may find it useful. I was quite proud of the ping-pong system I had setup. 

[schema.sql](https://github.com/Cherry/CherryAC/blob/master/schema.sql) contains a dump of my detections table with almost 1000 SteamIDs. I wouldn't recommend using it, and some of detections are only "possible" cheats, so be wary if you do make use of it for anything. "Incorrect source for RunConsoleCommand: =?" is generally SethHack and the rest are self explanatory.
